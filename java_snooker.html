<h1>A Java Applet: Snooker</h1>

Many years ago (mid 1990s) I wrote a simple Java Applet while
teaching myself the language. At the time of writing it was a
bit slow without a high-end processor, so I was overly worried
about performance. These days it runs just fine.

<p>

You may notice that I haven't quite got the <a href='rules.html'>rules</a> right; and some of the ball replacement
rules are a bit iffy. Even worse though, once you start applying spin,
you'll find that even the laws of physics are not quite right.

<p>

Just click the mouse over the cue ball and drag a line away from it.
The line represent the cue - its direction and power. Release the
mouse button and take the shot. If you mess up, and want to
re-take the shot: just press the space bar. The balls will be replaced.

<p>
There are several classes involved; so it may take a while to load.
Also, please note that netscape is somewhat challenged by it - I sometimes get NullPointer Exceptions from the Java engine. I think its because I used a firly old version of the Java libraries, and then wrote it under Microsoft.

I've had a request to make the source code available. Well,
<a href=src/>here it is</a>. Its not of high quality -- it wrote it a few years ago when learning the language. Its written for Java 1.0, so
you'll need to use the -deprecation flag when compiling it for
jdk 1.1 and above.
