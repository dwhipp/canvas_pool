<h2>Rules and Other Information</h2>

<p>
This pool-table simulation was created as an exercise to help me learn Javascript
(and HTML Canvas animations) in November 2009. Please feel free to reuse any parts
of the code that you find helpful (attribution is appreciated). Note that, because
it uses the HTML Canvas element, it will not work on all browsers. I&apos;ve so far only
tested it on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.
</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>
The user-interface to this pool table is fairly straight forward:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>First, select a game using the buttons at the top of the page: 8-Ball
    and 9-Ball are games with rules; 1-Ball and &quot;Empty Table&quot; are for practice.
    </li>
    <li>You will start out with &quot;ball in hand&quot;: move the cue ball using the mouse,
    and click to select the position. (If you get the wrong position then hit
    the &quot;9&quot; key to re-enter &quot;ball in hand&quot; mode)
    </li>
    <li>Once the cue ball is positioned, click on it, and hold the button down)
    to begin your shot. A &quot;cue&quot; should appear (a line stretching back
    from the ball): move the mouse away from the cue ball to increase the strength.
    A black bar should appear in the cue to indicate the strength. You can press-and-hold
    a number from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;7&quot; to modulate the strength-to-distance
    ratio
    </li>
    <li>Release the mouse button to make the shot.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>

You will most likely notice that the exact location where you click on the cue
ball effects the behavior of the ball during the shot. Relative to the direction
of the shot, hit-locations avoce and below the center will induce forward and
reverse spin; locations left and right will add size-spin (also known as
&quot;english&quot;). You you hold the &quot;8&quot; key during the shot then
this will be magnified.
</p>

<h2>9-Ball</h2>

<p>
The rules of 9-ball are simple: every shot, the cue ball must impact the lowest numbered
ball on the table and, after that impact, some ball must hit a cushion or be potted. If
you do pot any ball (except the cue ball, which is a foul), then you remain at the table
for another shot. The first player to pot the 9-ball wins.

</p>
<p>

If you commit a foul then your opponent gets ball in hand.

</p>
<p>

The ball numbers are:
<ul>
    <li> One ball -- Yellow </li>
    <li> Two ball -- Blue </li>
    <li> Three ball -- Red </li>
    <li> Four ball -- Purple </li>
    <li> Five ball -- Orange </li>
    <li> Six ball -- Green </li>
    <li> Seven ball -- Brown </li>
    <li> Eight ball -- Black </li>
    <li> Nine ball -- Gold with white dot </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>8-Ball</h2>

<p>
The game of 8-ball has 7 red balls, 7 yellow balls, and a black ball
(the &quot;Eight Ball&quot;).
</p>

<p>

The game starts with an open table: the cue ball can hit and pot any ball. The
first player to pot one or more red or yellow ball will own that color (if you
pot balls of both color then the table remains open). The other player
owns the other color. When you own a color, the cue ball must make its first
impact with a ball of that color.

</p>
<p>

When you have potted all the balls of the color that you own then you may play
the eight ball to win the game. If you pot the eight ball at any other time,
then you lose. Also, you lose if you commit a foul on a shot where you pot the
eight ball then you lose.

</p>

<h2>1-Ball, and &quot;Empty Table&quot;</h2>

<p>
These games are for practice: hit the ball(s) anywhere you want.
