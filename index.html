<h1>A Java Applet: Snooker</h1>

Many years ago (mid 1990s) I wrote a simple Java Applet while
teaching myself the language. At the time of writing it was a
bit slow without a high-end processor, so I was overly worried
about performance. These days it runs just fine.

<h1>An HTML-5 Canvas Pool Table</h1>

In Nov 2009 I started playing with the HTML-5 Canvas element, and have created a similar app entirely in HTML+Javascript.
